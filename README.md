Moving from Complexity to Clarity in Supply Chain
Description:
This project focuses on analyzing and optimizing supply chain operations using real-world data from a logistics company, Just In Time. The primary goal was to uncover inefficiencies across shipment, inventory, and order fulfillment processes. Through data-driven insights and interactive Tableau dashboards, the project provides business stakeholders with a clear understanding of operational bottlenecks and strategic recommendations for improvement.

Tools & Techniques:

Python: Data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis

Tableau: Interactive dashboard creation for business reporting

Methodology: Descriptive and exploratory analytics

Project Objectives:
Identify inefficiencies in inventory and shipment management

Analyze profit, cost, supply, and demand patterns

Evaluate warehouse inventory performance

Detect causes of shipment delays

Propose data-backed recommendations for operational improvements

Key Dashboards & Business Insights:
ðŸ“Œ Business Performance

Overview of total profit, product cost, best-selling and most profitable products

Profitability by product department and product category

ðŸ“¦ Inventory Management

Inventory by warehouse and department

Supply vs. demand comparisons

Identification of overstocked and understocked items

Analysis of inventory storage costs

ðŸšš Shipment Investigation

Percentage of delayed shipments

Delay trends over time

Shipment delays by location

Products most frequently delayed

âœ… Order Fulfillment

Fulfillment rates by product category

Warehouse performance in meeting order demand

Data Overview:
The dataset consists of three main tables:

order_and_shipment: Order details, product quantities, shipment modes, and dates

inventory: Monthly inventory levels, warehouse location, storage costs

fulfillment: Order fulfillment performance by product and category

Entity Highlights:

Customer: Identification and address details

Product: Name, department, and category

Order/Shipment: Dates, values, shipping mode, and delay analysis

Warehouse: Inventory storage, supply-demand balance, and cost efficiency

Key Insights:
1. Profit & Cost Analysis

Identified most profitable products and departments

Highlighted goods with the highest profit margins and highest storage costs

2. Inventory Efficiency

Found mismatches in supply vs. demand

Identified overstocked and understocked product categories impacting profitability

3. Shipment Delays

Analyzed delay trends, key problem areas, and product categories affected by frequent delays

4. Order Fulfillment

Evaluated average warehouse performance in fulfilling orders by product type

Recommendations:
Optimize Product Inventory:
Balance stock levels based on demand forecasts, especially for high-margin products, to reduce excess costs and prevent stockouts.

Reorganize Inventory Distribution:
Address understocking in high-demand departments (e.g., Fan Shop) and realign inventory across warehouses to reduce shipment delays.

Targeted Marketing Strategies:
Promote high-margin products, run strategic campaigns during peak seasons, and offer discounts to improve sales and inventory turnover.

Monitor & Reduce Shipment Delays:
Conduct further root cause analysis of shipping delays and resolve process bottlenecks to enhance customer satisfaction and delivery efficiency.
